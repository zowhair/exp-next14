        <h1>K2: The Savage Mountain</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Climbing K2 is considered the top mountaineering expedition in the whole world. "K" stands for the Karakoram range, and "2" denotes its position as the second-highest peak listed. Located near the Baltoro Glacier in the extreme north of Gilgit Baltistan, K2's boundary crosses between two countries.</p>

        <p>To reach the base camp of K2, climbers must navigate through action-packed and riveting hazards. George Bell, a famous American climber, named it the "Savage Mountain" in 1953, famously declaring that "K2 is a savage mountain that tries to kill you." It is also alternatively called "The King of Mountains" and "The Mountaineers' Mountain."</p>

        <p>K2 has never been climbed from its eastern face. Approximately 400 people have successfully climbed K2, while around 85 deaths have occurred during attempts. Climbers face key difficulties, including extremely high altitude and lack of oxygen, severe storms lasting several days resulting in fatalities, and the steep and exposed nature of the routes.</p>

        <p>The standard route, used by 75 percent of climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur, characterized by a series of rocks, snow and ice, black pyramids, and bottlenecks. The North Ridge route is rarely climbed due to its challenges.</p>

        <p>Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world, is located in the Diamir District of Gilgit, Pakistan. The word "Nanga Parbat" is derived from Sanskrit, meaning "The Naked Mountain". Also known as Diamer or Deo Mir, this peak is infamous for its difficult climb and climber fatalities.</p>

        <p>Lying to the south of the Indus River and marking the western end of the Karakoram range to the north, Nanga Parbat is one of the most prominent peaks globally. In 1895, Albert F Mummery led an expedition to the peak, marking the beginning of its mountaineering history.</p>

        <p>Nanga Parbat is considered the most intimidating rock on the planet, requiring an extreme level of expertise and hard work to overcome. At least 31 people have lost their lives attempting to climb it. However, the base camp is relatively approachable.</p>

        <p>The honor of climbing Nanga Parbat belongs to Simon Moro from Italy, Alex Txikon from Spain, and Ali Sadpara from Pakistan. Striking views of Nanga Parbat can be enjoyed from Fairy Meadows, adding to the allure and mystique of this majestic mountain.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Gasherbrum, also known as K5, is the 11th highest mountain in the world and is often referred to as the hidden mountain due to its remoteness. The name "Gasherbrum" means "The shining wall" or "beautiful." It was first climbed in 1958 by Pete Schoening, Andy Kauffman, and 8 others. Situated in tight clusters on the upper reaches of the Baltoro Glacier, the mountain offers a challenging ascent from its base.</p>

        <p>Climbers typically start the ascent from the bottom of the mountain, carrying all necessary gear without the need for route preparations or oxygen cylinders. Despite its ranking among the highest peaks, Gasherbrum is not as popular or well-known as other 8000-meter peaks. However, it is one of the peaks with the least recorded deaths, emphasizing its remote and challenging nature.</p>

        <p>The most common route to Gasherbrum is taken from the west, leading to the Japanese Couloir located in the northwest. The first winter ascent was achieved in 2012 by Poles Bielecki and Golab. Climbers need to obtain permits from Islamabad to climb Gasherbrum I, adding to the logistical challenges of scaling this formidable peak.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Broad Peak, located on the border of Pakistan and China, stands as the 12th highest mountain in the world. Known locally as "Falchan Kangri," it earns its name from the immense breadth at the top. Despite its challenges, Broad Peak is considered one of the easiest 8000-meter peaks to climb, although climbers must be physically strong and possess extensive skills and expertise.</p>

        <p>The climb begins steep and presents continuous challenges throughout, with the upper sections being particularly dangerous. The first ascent of Broad Peak was achieved on June 9, 1957, by Fritz Winterstellar, Herman Buhl, and Kurt Diemberger from Austria. Remarkably, they accomplished this feat without the aid of oxygen supplements, base camp support, or porters.</p>

        <p>Broad Peak offers an incredible expedition experience for those seeking an 8000-meter climb with less technicality than K2, located opposite to it. However, climbers must have prior experience of climbing peaks at least 6800 meters high before attempting Broad Peak. Despite its accessibility, the climb offers an awe-inspiring adventure that draws climbers from around the world.</p>
